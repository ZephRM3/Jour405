# Introduction

Multiple regression analysis is a statistical method used to understand the relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. This analysis is particularly useful in journalism for exploring complex relationships in civic data, such as how different demographic and socioeconomic factors collectively impact voter turnout. By understanding these relationships, journalists can provide deeper insights into civic participation patterns and identify potential barriers to voting.

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
#install.packages('corrplot')
library(corrplot)
```

## Load the Data

The first step in our analysis is to load the data. Here we read the data from a CSV file, which contains information about voter turnout and various demographic factors across Maryland counties. This dataset will be used to build our model that will try to see which factors are most important in predicting voter turnout. The turnout percentage is from the 2024 general election.

```{r}
md_turnout <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_turnout.csv")
head(md_turnout)
```

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (5 points)

Before building our model, let's explore the data to understand the variables and their relationships. Examine the correlation matrix to see how the independent variables relate to each other and to the dependent variable (voter turnout). Which variables seem to be correlated? Are there any that are not correlated at all? Also look at the multiple scatterplots. Which variables seem to have a linear relationship with the dependent variable? Which do not?

ANSWER HERE

When you look at the matrix it's clear that the most correlated variables to voter turnout are income related. Income (duh), and unemployment. Unemployment is negatively correlated which means that the lower the unemployment the higher the turnout. The scatter plots also back this up as the plots that have the clearest linear relationships are again unemployment and income. Population and percentage of bachelors seems to have the least linear relatiobships or at least have the most outliers. 

```{r}
# Summary statistics
summary(md_turnout)

# Create correlation matrix
selected_vars <- md_turnout |> 
  select(turnout, population, income, pct_bachelors_higher, 
         pct_unemployed, median_age, pct_white)
correlation_matrix <- cor(selected_vars)
print(correlation_matrix)

# Visualize correlation matrix
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "circle")

# Create scatterplots
md_turnout |>
  pivot_longer(cols = c(population, income, pct_bachelors_higher, 
                       pct_unemployed, median_age, pct_white),
               names_to = "variable", 
               values_to = "value") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = turnout)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Relationship between predictors and voter turnout",
       y = "Voter turnout (%)")
```

## Task 2: Initial Model Evaluation (5 points)

Next, we construct an initial linear model to analyze how different factors influence voter turnout across Maryland counties. This model helps us quantify the relationships and assess which factors are significant predictors of turnout. 

### Residuals

The residuals of a model are the differences between observed values and the values predicted by the model. For this model:

* **Min and Max** values indicate the range of residuals. 
* **Median** value tells us if the model is generally centered around the actual data points.

### Coefficients

The coefficients tell us the estimated effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable:

* **Population**: Is the coefficient positive or negative? Is it statistically significant?
* **Income**: Does higher income correlate with higher turnout?
* **Education (pct_bachelors_higher)**: How does education level impact voter participation?
* **Unemployment**: Is there a relationship between unemployment and voter turnout?
* **Median Age**: Do counties with older populations have different turnout rates?
* **Race (pct_white)**: Is there a relationship between racial composition and turnout?

### Model Fit

* **Residual Standard Error**: How much does the model typically deviate from actual turnout?
* **Multiple R-squared**: What percentage of the variability in turnout is explained by the model?
* **Adjusted R-squared**: How well does the model fit after accounting for the number of variables?
* **F-statistic**: Is the model as a whole statistically significant?


Examine the output of the model, checking the coefficients, residuals, and overall model fit. How well does this multiple variable model predict turnout? Do any of the variables seem to be insignificant? Is this a useful model, based on what you've seen? Why?

ANSWER HERE

This model is a good predictor of turnout based on these findings. The median and Min/Max show consistency in the data, the residuals are very tight, and both the R values are over 80% which indicates to me that the data model is accurate. The P-Value for the model is also tiny which is good, but some of the indpependant variables are shown to not be as important like population.

```{r}
# Build initial model with all predictors
initial_model <- lm(turnout ~ population + income + pct_bachelors_higher + 
                   pct_unemployed + median_age + pct_white, data = md_turnout)
summary(initial_model)

```

## Task 3: Model Refinement (5 points)

Create three alternative models by adding or removing variables to see if we can improve the model's performance. Turnout will always be the dependent variable, but you should alter the independent variables by removing or adding some. Then compare the models using adjusted R-squared values. Are any of the models significantly better than the others?

ANSWER HERE

I was able to make a model that has an even higher adjusted R-Squared value than the original model by removing the population and higher percentage of bachelors variables. It's not a a lot better, but it's about .02 I would say. I then made a model with all the "bad" variables i.e. population, bachelors, and I threw in white percentage and age. This model was much worse at predicting turnout by a lot. However it wasn't as bad as the model I made which just looked at unemployment and income which was much worse than even model three. This I think shows that median age, and demographics play a pretty significant role in being able to predict election turnout and you can't just purely look at income related statistics.

```{r}
# Model 2
model2 <- lm(turnout ~ income + 
    pct_unemployed + median_age + pct_white, data = md_turnout)
summary(model2)

# Model 3
model3 <- lm(turnout ~ population + pct_white + pct_bachelors_higher + median_age, data = md_turnout)
summary(model3)

# Model 4
model4 <- lm(turnout ~ income + pct_unemployed, data = md_turnout)
summary(model4)

# Compare models
cat("Model 1 (Full model) - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(initial_model)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 2 - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(model2)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 3 - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(model3)$adj.r.squared, "\n")
cat("Model 4 - Adjusted R-squared:", summary(model4)$adj.r.squared, "\n")

# Create comparison chart
model_names <- c("Full model", "Model 2", "Model 3", "Model 4")
adj_r_squared <- c(summary(initial_model)$adj.r.squared,
                   summary(model2)$adj.r.squared,
                   summary(model3)$adj.r.squared,
                   summary(model4)$adj.r.squared)

model_comparison <- data.frame(Model = model_names, Adjusted_R_squared = adj_r_squared)
ggplot(model_comparison, aes(x = reorder(Model, Adjusted_R_squared), y = Adjusted_R_squared)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Model Comparison by Adjusted R-squared",
       x = "Model")
```


## Task 4: Using the Model (3 points)

Without using the words "multiple regression model", describe how you could use this analysis to cover an election or voter participation story.

ANSWER HERE

This data shows us that age, income, unemployment, and demographics are key to knowing who's going to come out to vote. You can then look at the places a candiate is campaigning, and then perhaps the areas that candidate is relying on to get votes, and gauge how likely that area is to perform well for that candidate. If a candidate is basing there hopes on winning an election by gaining votes in an area that is super young, and has super high unemployment, and low income levels, we could look at this model and say that strategy might not work out for that candidate based on this analysis.
