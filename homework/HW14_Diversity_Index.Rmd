## Overview

In this exercise, we will calculate the **USA TODAY Diversity Index** for Maryland cities with a population of at least 10,000 using 2020 Census race and ethnicity data. The Diversity Index reflects the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a city are of different races or ethnicities.

A score of 0 indicates no diversity (everyone is the same race/ethnicity), while a score closer to 100 indicates higher diversity. The **most diverse city** has the highest index, reflecting a balanced mix of several racial and ethnic groups. The **least diverse** city likely has one overwhelmingly dominant racial/ethnic group.

## Task 1: Load and Describe the Data (3 points)

Run the following code to load the data, then examine it and describe what it contains. Based on the raw numbers alone, which cities stand out as diverse to you?

**ANSWER HERE**

German town seems like a vary diverse city, half the population is white, but there are also large Hispanic, Asian and Black populations as well. Baltimore obviously, and Columbia also.

```{r load-data}
md_cities <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/usat_diversity_index.csv")

# Preview structure
View(md_cities)
```

## Task 2: Calculate Race Percentages

```{r race-percentages}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    White_pct = White / TotalPop,
    Black_pct = Black / TotalPop,
    Native_pct = Native / TotalPop,
    Asian_pct = Asian / TotalPop,
    NHPI_pct = NHPI / TotalPop
  )
```

## Task 3: Square the Race Percentages

We need to square the race percentages in order to calculate the probability that any two people chosen at random from a given census area are of different races or are Hispanic or not.

```{r square-race}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    White_pct_sq = White_pct^2,
    Black_pct_sq = Black_pct^2,
    Native_pct_sq = Native_pct^2,
    Asian_pct_sq = Asian_pct^2,
    NHPI_pct_sq = NHPI_pct^2
  )
```


## Task 4: Calculate Race Probabilities (3 points)

The race probability is the sum the squared probabilities for each of the races. It represents the probability that two people randomly chosen from the same city will be of the same race. Which city has the highest race probability, and why do you think that is?

**ANSWER HERE**

```{r}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(race_prob = White_pct_sq + Black_pct_sq + Asian_pct_sq + Native_pct_sq + NHPI_pct_sq)
```

I would say Summerfield, I was going to answer that just based off intuition, but decided to run the code above to see if I was right. Summerfield just has an overwhelmingly Black population which makes it more likely that if you pick two people they will both be black.

```{r race-prob}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    Race_Prob = White_pct_sq + Black_pct_sq + Native_pct_sq + Asian_pct_sq + NHPI_pct_sq
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(Race_Prob))

View(md_cities)
```

(I swear to god, I dodn't even look at this code when I answered the above question. That was dumb.)

## Task 5: Calculate Ethnicity Percentages and Their Squares (3 points)

Hispanic origin is not a race but an ethnicity or nationality â€“ and a separate Census question. The probability someone is Hispanic or not Hispanic must be calculated separately from race, and Hisp_Prob is the probability that two randomly selected people will be Hispanic or not. That's an important distinction, because unlike race probability, this measures the likelihood of a binary question: that both random people will be Hispanic. What do you notice about the cities with the *lowest* Hisp_Prob scores?

**ANSWER HERE**

The diversity of the cities are also quite high.

```{r ethnicity}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    HispTotal = HISPANIC + NotHispanic,
    Hisp_pct = HISPANIC / HispTotal,
    NotHisp_pct = NotHispanic / HispTotal,
    Hisp_pct_sq = Hisp_pct^2,
    NotHisp_pct_sq = NotHisp_pct^2,
    Hisp_Prob = Hisp_pct_sq + NotHisp_pct_sq
  ) |> 
  arrange(Hisp_Prob)

View(md_cities)
```

## Task 6: Multiply Race and Ethnicity Probabilities

Here we multiply the two probabilities together to get the probability that any two random people have the SAME race and ethnicity.

```{r combined-prob}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    RaceEth_Prob = Race_Prob * Hisp_Prob
  )
```


## Task 7: Calculate Diversity Index (3 points)

The final step is to calculate the probability that two people randomly chosen WILL NOT BE OF THE SAME RACE OR ETHNICITY. In other words, the highest index scores will be cities where those two random people will be from different backgrounds. Put simply, more diverse. Which cities are the top 3, and where are they located? Look at the bottom of the list - which city is the least diverse, and where is it?

**ANSWER HERE**
Top 3:
Langley Park (PG County)
Wheaton Maryland (Montgomery County)
Adelphi (PG County)

Bottom:
Lake Shore (Anne Arundel County)


```{r diversity-index}
md_cities <- md_cities |>
  mutate(
    Diversity_Index = (1 - RaceEth_Prob) * 100
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(Diversity_Index))

View(md_cities)
```

### Pitch a story (8 points)

Given the data that you've produced here, write a headline and lede of the most interesting story from this exercise, and add below that details on how you would report it out: who you'd talk to and the questions you'd ask. When you describe the Diversity Index values, do so in a similar way to how USA Today did; the raw values themselves won't mean much to readers.

**ANSWER HERE**

Urban counties in Maryland are becoming more diverse

Prince George's County and Montgomery continue to be some of the most diverse counties in Maryland. Data shows that within the cities and towns in these counties, the chances that you will see two people of different races or identities on the street is very high.

Details:

For this story I would really want to look at data from the last census, because without it I really have no story. The story to me would be in the change in percentages, otherwise it feels bland. I'd then probably want to talk to experts in demographics, and ask if this change is normal, or not-normal or if it's expected or unexpected, and if it's unexpected then why that is.
